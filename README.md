# babel-template

A simple template repo for using babel to write ES6 (AKA ES2015) code. I got tired of having to try and copy/paste from previous repos, and/or search for what I need on google. You can easily create a new repo by using the Template button within github (instead of cloning). This will give you a new repo with a copy of all of the files, and your origin already set, etc.
